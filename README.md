### power.html

Can not do the power supply control strictly in JavaScript due to the
cross domain issue. So to get this to work need as server. Due to this
this project was not completed on 5/31/16.

### Bugs

Can not browser-sync from the parent directory to serve this directory because
it always crashed. For some reason this does not happen when browser-sync is
called from the gulp file.
